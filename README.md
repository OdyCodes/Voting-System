# IMPORTANT End of new updates
The Voting System will no longer get new updates, since the program has no bugs and there is no room for improvment from my part.

# Voting System
These are the files for the Voting System Python project.

# Bugs
I usually fix bugs on my own but if you find one, post an issue and I will look into it. If you have the time, feel free to fix it as well!
